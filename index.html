<p> <h2>The general history of HURD band</h2> </p>
<p>Hurd is a Mongolian rock band formed in 1987 by drummer Dambyn Ganbayar, Hurd is considered the first band to have introduced the heavy metal genre into the Mongolian music landscape.</p>
<p> Along with Chingis Khaan, Haranga or Niciton, they are considered "veterans" of the Mongolian pop rock scene, and, as such, they have greatly contributed to its diversification and encouraged the emergence of many new rock acts.</p>
<p>Hurd has released nine studio albums, one live album, one compilation album, two video albums and one box set. The band has won numerous Pentatonic Awards (Mongolia's equivalent of the Grammy Award) and Golden Microphone Awards.</p>
<p> Guitarist Dambyn Otgonbayar is a member of the Pentatonic Academy. Drummer Dambyn Ganbayar is a board member of the Mongolian Drummers Association.</p>
<p>In November 2009, singer Dambyn Tömörtsog and bassist Namsraijavyn Naranbaatar were respectively awarded with the Merited Artist of Mongolia and the Polar Star awards. </p>

<p> <h2> Style and lyrical themes </h2> </p>  
<p>Influenced by heavy metal and hard rock bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, WASP, Judas Priest or Guns N' Roses, Hurd's earlier material was classic heavy metal. 
</p>
<p>Some songs are reminiscent of traditional Mongolian music, using pentatonic scales, traditional melody styles and instruments, most notably morin khuur. Also characteristic are ballads, which often revolve around the theme of love, respect for parents or national pride.</p> 
<p>The band's roots in tradition and a focus on national pride make them especially popular in rural areas of Mongolia, as well as with Mongolian migrant workers abroad, such as in South Korea. They are also popular in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and their sales figures for tapes and CDs are higher there than at home. When they first tried to enter into the Chinese market, they faced various problems: officials asked them to translate their lyrics from Mongolian into Chinese, and then banned some of them.</p>

<p>Hurd usually writes songs by composing music around proses and poems coming from either regular contributors or anonymous people. </p> <br>
